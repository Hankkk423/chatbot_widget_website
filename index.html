            Welcome to the ChatBot Widget Website project! This project showcases the integration of an interactive chat
            bot widget into a website to engage users in conversations related to artificial intelligence (AI). The
            widget can be created dynamically using JavaScript and customized using CSS styles.

            The ChatBot Widget Website project explores the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and frontend web
            development. By integrating a dynamic chat bot widget into a website, this project provides an interactive
            way to learn about AI concepts and engage with the technology.

            API-Powered Interaction: One of the key features of this project is its ability to communicate with an AI
            chat bot server. Through API requests, messages sent from the website are transmitted to the server for
            processing. The server formulates responses using AI-driven algorithms, and these responses are then
            returned to the website. This bidirectional communication enables a dynamic and interactive conversation
            between users and the AI-powered chat bot.

            Whether you're a web developer exploring the potential of frontend scripting or an individual interested in
            learning about AI, this project serves as a practical and engaging resource. Experience firsthand how AI
            technology is leveraged to enhance user interactions and provide insightful responses, all within the
            context of a user-friendly web interface.

            The journey through the intersections of AI and web development begins with this project. Embark on this
            exploration to gain insights into the possibilities and innovations that arise when AI meets the digital
            frontier.
