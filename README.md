# ChatBot Widget Dynamically Created on Website

Welcome to the ChatBot Widget Website project! This project showcases the integration of an interactive chat bot widget into a website to engage users in conversations related to artificial intelligence (AI). The widget can be created dynamically using JavaScript and customized using CSS styles.

## Introduction

The ChatBot Widget Website project explores the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and frontend web development. By integrating a dynamic chat bot widget into a website, this project provides an interactive way to learn about AI concepts and engage with the technology.

**API-Powered Interaction:** One of the key features of this project is its ability to communicate with an AI chat bot server. Through API requests, messages sent from the website are transmitted to the server for processing. The server formulates responses using AI-driven algorithms, and these responses are then returned to the website. This bidirectional communication enables a dynamic and interactive conversation between users and the AI-powered chat bot.

Whether you're a web developer exploring the potential of frontend scripting or an individual interested in learning about AI, this project serves as a practical and engaging resource. Experience firsthand how AI technology is leveraged to enhance user interactions and provide insightful responses, all within the context of a user-friendly web interface.

The journey through the intersections of AI and web development begins with this project. Embark on this exploration to gain insights into the possibilities and innovations that arise when AI meets the digital frontier.

## Features

- **Dynamic Widget Creation:** The project includes both static and dynamic widget creation methods. The dynamic approach, using `dynamicManipulate.js`, generates the entire chat bot widget and its functionality dynamically, enhancing user interaction.

- **User-Interface Customization:** You can tailor the style of the chat bot widget to match your website's design. The widget's appearance can be controlled through the use of `staticManipulate.js`, `style.css`, and HTML elements, allowing for seamless integration.


## Usage

- To use the dynamic chat bot widget:

Include dynamicManipulate.js in your website to dynamically create the chat bot widget.
Implement the widget's behavior using the provided JavaScript functions

- To custom the chat bot style: 

You can control the style of the ChatBot by using "staticManipulate.js", "style.css" and "the first part of HTML code". Once you've done modifying the CSS style and HTML elements, you can update "dynamicManipulate.js" correspondingly to match the style you changed.

- Engage with the chat bot widget:

Type messages in the user input area and press "Enter" to interact with the chat bot.
Observe how the chat bot responds to user inputs based on predefined interactions or AI-driven responses.
