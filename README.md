# ChatBot Widget Dynamically Created on Website

The Javascript will dynamically create the entire ChatBot Widget on website, including CSS style. You will only need to add one line of javascript code on HTML file.

## Installation

See requirements.txt

## Usage

- Simply add "dynamicManipulate.js" to your website, and that's it.

- You can control the style of the ChatBot by using "staticManipulate.js", "style.css" and "the first part of HTML code". Once you've done modifying the CSS style and HTML elements, you can update "dynamicManipulate.js" to match the style you changed.
